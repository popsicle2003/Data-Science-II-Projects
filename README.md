# Data-Science-II-Projects

Instructions: 

1.Place the four .scala files in src\main\scala\example in your scalation_2.0 directory.

2. Place the cleaned csv files(My python program preprocesses the files) into data\outputs\cleaned\for\scala

Run sbt then each scala one at a time. Lowk best way to interpret results is put it into the chatbot, I am sorta sick when I was doing all of this so I cannot be bothered to put more efforts. Good luck
